# About the Project

This is a Data Analysis project to demonstrate my skills in Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. 

It included a Star Wars movies network analysis I conducted during the course of "Social Network Analysis", Department of Management Sciene and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Bussiness

It includes data for every Star Wars Movie (episodes)

I analyzed the data for the first seven (7) episodes

## Tools Used

To conduct the analysis i used Python 3, pandas through Jupyter Notebook
