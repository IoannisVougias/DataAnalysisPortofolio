# About the Project

This is a Data Analysis project to demonstrate my skills in SQL programming language. This project includes one (1) .sql file named "CovidCasesQueries" containing the SQL queries i run and two (2) .xlsx files containing the datasets used.

## About the Dataset

The dataset was downloaded through the website <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" target="_blank">ourworldindata.org</a>.

It includes data for every official case and death that was cause from Covid-19 to day. It also has data regarding vaccination.

I analyzed data between the dates of 01/01/2020 to 30/04/2021 were Covid-19 was on the peak.

## Tools Used

To conduct the analysis i used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL programming language.

I also used Excel and Tableau to make a dashboard. ~See Below

## Queries

Some queries i run to analyze the data.

1) Find The percentage of cases that ended in death, regarding Greece
2) Find the percentage of population that was infected by covid-19, regarding Greece
3) Find countries with the highest infection count and rate per population
4) Find continents with the highest death count per population

After joining the two tables 

5) Find the cummulative Percentage of vaccinated population

and more..

## Visualization

Below you can see a very basic dashboard i created based on 4 simple queries. To begin with i copied the results i wanted manually from SSMS to excel. After that i did some data cleaning (replace nulls) in order to upload the excel files into Tableau public. Following this, i created 4 sheets with simple visualizations and merged them into the dashboard you see below.
