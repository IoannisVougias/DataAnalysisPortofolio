# About the Project

International sports events can shape repression in authoritarian host countries by causing autocrats to strategically adjust their level of repression based on the presence of international media. Using data from the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, it was found that the host government largely refrained from repression during the tournament but preemptively cleared the streets beforehand, specifically around hotels reserved for foreign journalists. This suggests that autocracies may try to avoid being exposed for their wrongdoings by media during these events.

This is a Data Analysis project to demonstrate my skills in Python programming language. This project includes one(1) .ipynb file containing the final code.

This analysis contains several replications of figures and regression models in Python based on the following paper.

Scharpf, A., Gläßel, C., Pearce, E. (2022) International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies: Evidence from the 1978 FIFA World Cup, American Political Science Review, 1-18. https://doi:10.1017/S0003055422000958.

The .ipynb contains full detailed information on the datasets, the procedure and the analysis done.

## Tools Used

To conduct the analysis i used Jupyter Notebook and Python.
