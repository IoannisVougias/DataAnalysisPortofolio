# About the Project

This is a Data Analysis project to demonstrate my skills in Python programming language. This project includes one(1) .ipynb file containing the final code.

This analysis contains several visual replications of figures and regression models in Python based on the following paper.

Scharpf, A., Gläßel, C., Pearce, E. (2022) International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies: Evidence from the 1978 FIFA World Cup, American Political Science Review, 1-18. https://doi:10.1017/S0003055422000958.

The .ipynb contains full detailed information on the datasets, the procedure and the analysis done.
