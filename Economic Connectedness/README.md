# About the Project

This is a Data Analysis project to demonstrate my skills in Python programming language. This project includes five (5) .csv files, two (2) .dta files containg the datasets i used and one (1) .ipnynb file containing the final code.

This analysis contains several visual replications of figures in Python based on the the following papers.

Chetty, R., Jackson, M.O., Kuchler, T. et al. Social capital I: measurement and associations with economic mobility. Nature 608, 108–121 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04996-4.

## About the Dataset

#### Below is the list of all the unique files used in this notebook:
For the **first** plot
* 'social_capital_county.csv'
* 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json'

For the **second** plot
* 'county_outcomes_simple.csv'

For the **third** plot
* 'zip_covariates.csv', converted file from original 'zip_covariates.dta'
* 'social_capital_zip.csv'

For the **fourth** plot
* 'social_capital_high_school.csv'

For the **fifth** plot
* 'college_characteristics.csv', converted file from original 'college_characteristics.dta'
* 'social_capital_college.csv'

In some plots files from previous ones were used.

## Tools Used

To conduct the analysis i used Jupyter Notebook and Python.
